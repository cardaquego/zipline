If you are looking for a way to tune your OBD1 Honda ECU and unleash its full potential, you might want to check out HONDA CROME PRO. CROME stands for Cui ROM Editor, a software developed by John Cui and members of the pgmfi.org forum that lets you edit and add extra features to your stock OBD1 Honda ECU[^1^] [^2^]. This allows you to run your Honda with forced induction systems (such as turbo or supercharger) or individual throttle bodies like it was stock[^1^]. You can also modify other parameters such as rev limits, VTEC engagement, fuel and ignition maps, and more[^2^].

But what makes HONDA CROME PRO different from the free version of CROME? Well, for starters, you get access to advanced features such as data logging, live tuning, auto tuning, smart suggestion, and CROME Gold ROM support[^1^] [^2^]. These features enable you to monitor and adjust your engine's performance in real time, using recorded data from the ECU. You can also use the auto tuner feature to automatically adjust the fuel maps based on the target air-fuel ratios. The smart suggestion feature helps you fine-tune the fuel maps by calculating the optimal values for each cell. And with CROME Gold ROM support, you can use a single ROM file that contains all the features you need without having to use plugins[^1^].
 
HONDA CROME PRO is not only a powerful tool for tuning your OBD1 Honda ECU, but also a cost-effective one. For only $50, you can get a lifetime license that allows you to use CROME PRO on any number of computers and ECUs[^2^]. You can also upgrade to CROME Dealer for $150 if you want to save and burn custom Gold ROMs for your customers[^1^]. Compared to other tuning solutions that require expensive hardware and software, HONDA CROME PRO is a bargain.

## How to Install HONDA CROME PRO
 
Installing HONDA CROME PRO is not as simple as plugging in a device or downloading a software. You need to have some technical skills and tools to install the CROME PRO unit into your OBD1 Honda ECU. The CROME PRO unit is designed to fit into the USDM rectangular or 'large case' OBD1 Civic/Integra style ECU's. You also need to make sure you have the right ECU for your engine type and configuration. The compatible ECU's are: P06, PR4, P28, P30, P61, P72, and P75[^3^].
 
The installation process involves opening up your ECU case, desoldering some components from the circuit board, soldering the CROME PRO unit and some wires to the board, and closing up the case. You also need to perform a non-vtec to vtec ECU conversion if you are using a non-vtec ECU for a vtec engine[^3^]. This may sound intimidating, but with some patience and care, you can do it yourself. Alternatively, you can hire a professional tuner or an electronics shop to do it for you.
 
Once you have installed the CROME PRO unit into your ECU, you need to connect it to your laptop using a USB cable and install the CROME software. The software is free to download from the official website[^1^]. You also need to have a compatible chip burner device and an EPROM chip to program your ECU with the CROME software. The software allows you to open and edit stock Honda OBD1 ROMs or create your own custom ROMs with various features and plugins. You can also use the data logging, live tuning, auto tuning, and smart suggestion features to optimize your engine's performance[^1^] [^2^].
  
## The Benefits of HONDA CROME PRO
 
HONDA CROME PRO is not just a fancy gadget for your OBD1 Honda ECU. It is a powerful tuning system that can transform your engine's performance and efficiency. By using HONDA CROME PRO, you can enjoy the following benefits:
 
- You can run any VTEC or non-VTEC D/B/F/H series Honda engine with your OBD1 ECU, regardless of whether it is naturally aspirated or forced induction[^1^] [^2^]. You can also swap engines without having to swap ECU's.
- You can modify various parameters of your engine such as rev limits, VTEC engagement, fuel and ignition maps, boost control, launch control, nitrous control, and more[^1^] [^2^]. You can also add extra features such as COP ignition, wideband lambda sensor, knock sensor, speed limiter removal, and more[^1^].
- You can monitor and adjust your engine's performance in real time using the data logging, live tuning, auto tuning, and smart suggestion features of the CROME software[^1^] [^2^]. You can also use the graph view and lambda logger features to visualize your fuel and ignition curves and air-fuel ratios[^1^].
- You can save money and time by using HONDA CROME PRO instead of other tuning solutions that require expensive hardware and software[^2^]. You can also use the same CROME PRO unit for multiple ECU's and engines by simply changing the EPROM chip[^2^].

With HONDA CROME PRO, you can unleash the full potential of your OBD1 Honda ECU and engine. Whether you want more power, more efficiency, or more fun from your Honda, HONDA CROME PRO can help you achieve it.
