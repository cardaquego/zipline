# How to Use Cheat Engine in Dark Souls 3 Offline Mode
 
Dark Souls 3 is a challenging game that rewards skill, patience and perseverance. But sometimes, you may want to spice things up, experiment with different builds, or just have some fun with cheats. That's where Cheat Engine comes in.
 
Cheat Engine is a program that allows you to modify game data manually, such as your stats, items, weapons, effects and more. However, using Cheat Engine online can result in soft bans, which limit your online play to servers with other banned players. To avoid this, you need to play in offline mode.
