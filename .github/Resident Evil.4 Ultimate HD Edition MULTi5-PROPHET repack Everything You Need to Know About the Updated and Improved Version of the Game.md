Resident Evil 4 is one of the most acclaimed and influential games in the survival horror genre. It was originally released in 2005 for the GameCube and PlayStation 2, and later ported to other platforms, including PC. In 2014, Capcom released Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition, a remastered version of the game with improved graphics, sound, and performance.

However, some fans were not satisfied with the official HD edition, and decided to create their own fan-made project to enhance the game even further. The Resident Evil 4 HD Project is a mod that replaces the original textures, models, animations, and effects with high-resolution versions, while preserving the original art style and atmosphere. The project took over eight years to complete, and was finally released in February 2022.
 
The Resident Evil 4 HD Project is not a standalone game, but a mod that requires the Steam version of Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition to run. The mod is free to download from the official website[^2^], but it also requires 37 GB of extra storage space. The installation process is not very complicated, but it involves running an installer as administrator, pressing some keys, and selecting some options[^1^]. The mod also comes with an optional patch that fixes some bugs and adds some features, such as subtitles and controller support.
 
The result is a stunning improvement over the original game, with crisp and detailed textures, realistic lighting and shadows, smooth animations, and enhanced sound effects. The game looks like a modern title, but still retains its classic charm and gameplay. The mod also respects the artistic vision of the original developers, and does not alter any story elements or gameplay mechanics. The mod is compatible with all languages and regions of the game.
 
Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition MULTi5-PROPHET repack is a compressed version of the game that includes both the official HD edition and the fan-made HD project mod. It also includes some bonus content, such as costumes, weapons, and modes. The repack reduces the size of the game from 37 GB to 6.2 GB, making it easier to download and install. However, some users may experience some issues with the repack, such as missing files or corrupted data.
