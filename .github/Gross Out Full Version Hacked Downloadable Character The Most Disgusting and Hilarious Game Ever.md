- Buy a proper gaming mouse. A gaming mouse can give you more precision and control over your character, as well as customizable buttons and settings. You can also adjust the sensitivity and DPI of your mouse to suit your preference[^3^].
- Use short, controlled bursts. When using weapons that can overheat, such as the fart blaster or the laser gun, avoid holding down the fire button for too long. Instead, use short, controlled bursts to avoid overheating and wasting ammo[^1^].
- Aim for the weak spots. Different enemies have different weak spots that can deal more damage or disable their abilities. For example, you can aim for Lance Boil's pus launcher to stop him from shooting pus at you, or Insectiva's bug spray to stop her from summoning insects.
- Be nice and work as a team. Gross Out is a multiplayer game that requires teamwork and cooperation. Always flip back your teammates if they are on their back, give them space to shoot, and stick together to avoid being outnumbered. A team that works together has a better chance of winning[^1^].

Gross Out is a fun and gross game that can provide hours of entertainment. Whether you play it online or offline, with friends or strangers, you can enjoy the quirky characters and settings of the Grossology series. Have fun and gross out!
