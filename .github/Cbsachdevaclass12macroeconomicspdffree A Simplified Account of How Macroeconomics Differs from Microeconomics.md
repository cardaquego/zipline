- A title tag is the page title that shows up in search results. It should be unique, descriptive, concise, and click-worthy. It should also match the search intent of your target audience and include your main keyword if possible. A good title tag should be less than 60 characters long. - A meta description is a snippet of text that summarizes the content of your page. It also shows up in search results below the title tag. It should be relevant, informative, and persuasive. It should also include your main keyword and a call to action if appropriate. A good meta description should be less than 160 characters long. - A meta robots tag is a directive that tells search engines how to crawl and index your page. You can use it to allow or disallow indexing, crawling, or following links on your page. For example, if you want your page to be indexed and crawled, but not to follow any links on it, you can use this tag: <meta name="\&quot;robots\&quot;" content="\&quot;index,nofollow\&quot;">. - A meta refresh redirect tag is a way to redirect your page to another URL after a certain amount of time. However, this is not recommended for SEO purposes, as it can confuse users and search engines. Instead, you should use a 301 permanent redirect or a 302 temporary redirect to indicate the new location of your page. - A meta charset tag is a way to specify the character encoding of your page. This helps browsers and search engines to interpret your text correctly. For example, if you want to use UTF-8 encoding, which is the most common and recommended one, you can use this tag: <meta charset="\&quot;UTF-8\&quot;">. - A meta viewport tag is a way to control how your page looks on different devices and screen sizes. This helps to improve the user experience and responsiveness of your page. For example, if you want your page to fit the width of the device and have a reasonable zoom level, you can use this tag: <meta name="\&quot;viewport\&quot;" content="\&quot;width=device-width," initial-scale="1\&quot;">.
